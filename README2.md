## Introduction

Superconductor is a novel, elegant, transport-layer-agnostic microframework for implementing the Model Context Protocol 
(MCP) within your laravel applications! Setup only takes a few steps -
1. Install the package
2. Install a supported transport package and now you have an MCP Server

Couple this package with a compatible Agent-generator and you have a tool-management setup for Agents!
The modular nature of this package enables developer to support any transport protocols they wish and none that they 
don't!
